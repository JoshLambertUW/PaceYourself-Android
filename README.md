# PaceYourself-Android

An app to track your athetic activities and race against your previous sessions. I made this app to practice Android development, Async API calls, threading, and Google Maps API development.

This app can:
- Start an activity using Google Maps
- Track your activity and give you the time and distance
- Save and display your previous activity with a Google Maps thumbnail
- Track your activity versus a previous activity
- Switch between metric and imperial units

To compile, import into your favorite IDE and insert your own Google Maps API_KEY into the AndroidManifest.xml.
